1.0 - Description

This inventory manager uses a menu system that accesses a variety of functions to control shoe objects.
These shoe objects are instantiated from and make permanent edits to a csv file that stores their information.
The functions include getting the cost of a shoe, the quantity, adding new types of shoes, viewing all shoes,
restocking the lowest quantity of shoe, searching for shoe information, getting the total value of stock,
and finding the shoe with the highest quantity. 
This program serves to demonstrate my understanding of OOP, but could realistically be used as a rudimentary
database if so desired.

2.0 - Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your computer https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Ensure both inventory.py and inventory.txt are located in the same folder.
3. Run the app using your favourite IDE (Pycharm or VSE recommended)
4. Enjoy!

3.0 - Usage

Simply enter the two letters for the operation you would like to perform on the inventory and then follow
the instructions as prompted.
Below, you can see the "view all" menu operation in action, as the program shows all shoe objects
instantiated from the csv file.
